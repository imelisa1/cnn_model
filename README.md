A basic CNN model that recognize objects. 

**Convolutional Neural Network**

   In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. The cnn architecture uses a special technique called Convolution instead of relying solely on matrix multiplications like traditional neural networks. Convolutional networks use a process called convolution, which combines two functions to show how one changes the shape of the other.

Requirements : 

* TensorFlow Keras : Used to load a model from TensorFlow Keras.

* NumPy :  Used for scientific computing and array operations.

* OpenCV : Used for image processing and computer vision.

* Matplotlib : Used for plotting and visualization.
